# ## For subjs 23-31,the functional data are saved in a format that differs from subjs 1-22.
# Within each subject_session folder - there are 8 series folders containing functional dicoms(labelled from 0001-0008).

# # Anatomical
# Subjs 26,27,28,29,30,31: MPRAGE was collected in session 1 of SC1 (folder is 0100)
# Subjs 23 + 25: MPRAGE was collected during the resting state scan (folder is 0100, saved in the folder ‘resting_state’)
# Subj 24: MPRAGE was collected in session 2 of SC1 (folder is 0100)
